# DeepSeek models - Strong reasoning, very affordable
# https://api-docs.deepseek.com/
#
# As of December 2025, both models are upgraded to DeepSeek-V3.2:
# - deepseek-chat: V3.2 non-thinking mode (general use)
# - deepseek-reasoner: V3.2 thinking mode (chain-of-thought reasoning)
#
# V3.2 is the first model to integrate thinking into tool-use,
# with 685B total parameters (MoE architecture).

# DeepSeek reasoning models use extended thinking (like o1)
# They don't support temperature/top_p during reasoning
_reasoning_unsupported: &reasoning_unsupported
  - temperature
  - top_p
  - presence_penalty
  - frequency_penalty
  - logprobs
  - top_logprobs
